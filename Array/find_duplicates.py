# How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?  
#Traverse the array once. 
#While traversing, keep track of count of all elements in the array using a temp array count[] of size n,
#when you see an element whose count is already set, print it as duplicate.
# This method uses the range given in the question to restrict the size of count[], 
#but doesnâ€™t use the data that there are only two repeating elements.

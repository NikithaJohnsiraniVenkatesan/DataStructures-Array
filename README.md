# DataStructures-Array

An array is the most fundamental data structure, which stores elements at a contiguous memory location.
The key benefit of an array data structure is that it offers fast O(1) search if you know the index, 
but adding and removing an element from an array is slow because you cannot change the size of the array once itâ€™s created.

The key to solving array-based questions is having a good knowledge of array data structure 
as well as basic programming constructors such as loop, recursion, and fundamental operators.


This repository contains some python codes of the popular array-based coding interview questions for the practice.
